title: "ðŸ§¹ Clean Up My Inbox"
---

Decluttering your inbox of old inactive conversations will help you focus on those that need replies today. 

To clear old conversations in bulk, use Cmd + K --\> Clean Up My Inbox (Ctrl + K on Windows) 

When you first connect your LinkedIn account to Kondo, you might have a large backlog of old conversations.

Select a time window, and Kondo will bulk archive all conversations older than that date

### What if I changed my mind?

You can restore archived conversations by going to the archive with Cmd + K \> "Go to Archive" and selecting conversations to restore.

When you get new messages, conversations automatically un-archive and return to the top of your inbox.

Archived conversations are always findable in search. 

### Does this keep running?

No, the clean up is a one-off action that happens only when you trigger it with the command, if you want to clean things up again, simply repeat.
