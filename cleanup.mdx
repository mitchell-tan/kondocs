title: "Clean Up My Inbox"
---

When you first connect your LinkedIn account to Kondo, it is likely that you have years of old messages sitting around.&#x20;

If you want to clean your inbox up quickly, try using the command "Clean Up My Inbox", you can find this in the command menu via Cmd + K (or Ctrl + K on a PC)

Select a time window, and Kondo will bulk archive all conversations older than that date

### What if I changed my mind?

You can always restore archived conversations by going to the archive with Cmd + K > "Go to Archive" and selecting conversations to restore.

Remember that when you get new messages, conversations automatically un-archive and return to the top of your inbox

### Does this keep running?

No, the clean up is a one-off action that happens only when you trigger it with the command, if you want to clean things up again, simply repeat.
