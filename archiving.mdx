Archive helps you keep your inbox clean by moving conversations with no pending action to storage. 

To archive a conversation, hit "E" or click the archive button. This works when you hover over a conversation in the list or when you are within a chat.

When you receive a new message in the conversation, it will automatically un-archive and go to the top of your inbox.

### Where to find archived conversations

There are 3 ways to find archived conversations 

1. Using search to find messages will look for all conversations, including those in the archive
2. If you are in a label inbox, you can open the filter to show "All Including Archived"
