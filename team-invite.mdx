Give other team members Kondo access to manage their LinkedIn inboxes and unlock collaborative features by adding them to your team. 

- Click the "Invite Team +" button 
- Send them the link or enter their email 

Team members who use your link will get 7 days of free access immediately

You can approve adding a seat for them and your billing will be updated with additional seats. 

### Seat management 

All team members can invite new team members, but only admins can make changes in seat assignments. 

When you add or remove seats, your billing will automatically adjust on the next billing cycle.
