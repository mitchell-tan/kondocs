You can push data on your LinkedIn conversations from Kondo to your own systems using webhooks.

To set up webhooks, simply go to [app.trykondo.com/webhooks](http://app.trykondo.com/webhooks) or look for the âš¡ button in the bottom right menu

### When we post data

There are two ways you can trigger syncs: streaming, and manual

* streaming: will update the sheet every time there is a change in Kondo e.g. new messages sent, received, labels or notes updated etc.

* manual: will only update the sheet upon manual triggering of sync

### What kind of data we post

You can see a sample of the data we post in [app.trykondo.com/webhooks/new](http://app.trykondo.com/webhooks/new)

<Info>
  Kondo syncs conversation history in two ways&#x20;

  1. latest message: this is synced in streaming mode or when you trigger syncs in the inbox list

  2. entire conversation: this is synced ONLY when you trigger a sync within an individual conversation

  these are separate fields in the payload sent&#x20;
