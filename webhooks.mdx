<Info>
  Note that webhooks are in beta and will be launched as part of our new Business Tier in mid-March
</Info>

You can push data on your LinkedIn conversations from Kondo to your own systems using webhooks.

To set up webhooks, simply go to [app.trykondo.com/webhooks](http://app.trykondo.com/webhooks)

### When we post data

There are two ways to trigger events posting to your webhook destination.

1. Streaming — selecting ‘general-update’ will fire events every time a change happens in Kondo e.g. receive new message, send new message, archive, change label, change notes, etc. etc.

2. Manual — unselect 'general-update' to only fire events when you manually select conversations and sync




   After you create your first webhook destination, you will see a sync ⚡ button at the top of each chat or when selecting conversations in the inbox with the checkboxes&#x9;
