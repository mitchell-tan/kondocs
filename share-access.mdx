title: "Sharing access"

### How do I grant access to my assistant or teammate?

They should:

- Create a new chrome profile
- Sign in to your LinkedIn account (they need your credentials, since Kondo does to get or store them, or any LinkedIn data on our servers)
- Sign in to your Kondo account (tied to Google, found in app.trykondo.com/settings)

### But I don’t want to give them access to my LinkedIn account

* Unfortunately we can’t help here, access to your LinkedIn DMs in Kondo requires an active login to LinkedIn on your browser

### But I don’t want to give them access to my Google account

* The Google account you use to login to Kondo does not have to be your main email, or the email tied to your LinkedIn account

* Many of our users use emails like [team@yourcompany.com](mailto:team@yourcompany.com) or [sales@yourcompany.com](mailto:sales@yourcompany.com) as their Kondo login in order to share access
