title: "Sharing access"

### How do I grant access to my assistant or teammate?

They should:

- Create a new chrome profile
- Sign in to your LinkedIn account (they need your credentials, since Kondo does to get or store them, or any LinkedIn data on our servers)
- Sign in to your Kondo account

### But I don’t want to give them access to my LinkedIn account

- Unfortunately we can’t help here, access to your LinkedIn DMs in Kondo requires an active login to LinkedIn on your browser

### But I don’t want to give them access to my email account

- If you used Google to sign in, you can create a email / password login
- Go to [settings](https://app.trykondo.com/settings), sign out of Kondo
- Click "Sign in with Email"
- Click 'Forgot your password?' to create a new password login
- You can now share these credentials with your teammates without giving them access to your email
