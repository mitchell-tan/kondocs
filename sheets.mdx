### Step 5. Select trigger type

There are two ways you can trigger syncs: streaming, and manual

- streaming: will update the sheet every time there is a change in Kondo e.g. new messages sent, received, labels or notes updated etc.
- manual: will only update the sheet upon manual triggering of sync

### Step 6: Manually trigger a sync

Once you have at least 1 destination set up, you can trigger a sync by selecting a few rows and clicking the ⚡ button or with Cmd + K \> Sync

  ### Note on syncing conversation history

  Kondo syncs conversation history in two ways

  1. latest message: this is synced in streaming mode or when you trigger syncs in the inbox list
  2. entire conversation: this is synced ONLY when you trigger a sync within an individual conversation
