### Overview

The Kondo \<\> HubSpot integration allows you to

- Sync DMs to the contact activity feed as LinkedIn Message objects
- Sync fields from Kondo such as labels, notes, and URL to HubSpot contact properties
- Add links to HubSpot and other HubSpot fields to the Kondo side panel

### Configuration

1. To connect Kondo to HubSpot, go to Settings -\> Integrations -\> HubSpot or click [this link](https://app.trykondo.com/integrations/hubspot) to connect and authenticate with a HubSpot admin account
2. Configure mapping for Kondo -\> HubSpot
   - We map records in Kondo to HubSpot records by using the contact's LinkedIn URL as an identifier.
   - Toggle 'Sync Messages' if you want to add DMs to the activity feed. If you leave this toggled off, only fields will sync.
   - Toggle 'Sync Contacts' if you want new Contacts to be created if one with a matching LinkedIn URL is not found.
   - Edit optional field mapping below if you want to map other Kondo properties to your own HubSpot custom fields
