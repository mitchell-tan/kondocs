Setting a reminder (shortcut H) temporarily archives a message, and returns it to the <u>top of your inbox</u> at the time it is due. 

If you get a new message before it is due, the reminder will be cancelled and the conversation will return to the top of your inbox

Due reminders will appear with a purple indicator dot

### Setting custom reminder times

If you want to set a reminder for a specific time not on the default list, simply type a time period e.g.

- next wednesday
- in 4 days
- thursday 10pm

### What happens in LinkedIn

We move conversations to the archive in LinkedIn too, and bring them back when reminders are due. They will however <u>not</u> sort to the top of your LinkedIn native inbox
