Kondo does not get, or store any of your linkedin data on our servers.

Messages, contacts, and any data from your linkedin account is stored locally on your device, and cannot be accessed remotely by us, anyone on our team, or any subprocessors we use. 

The only data stored in Kondo's servers is metadata generated within our app such as ids, labels, snippets, etc. None of this contains any of your LinkedIn or personal data. 

### Integrations 

When you send data to your destinations via webhooks, data is sent from your browser directly to your destination. We do not retain this data on our servers.
