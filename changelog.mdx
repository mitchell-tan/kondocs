  ## Sales Nav Messsages

  Kondo now pulls in messages from Sales Nav for business plan users.

  To enable this, simply

  - check that you're on a business plan in settings -\> billing
  - refresh Kondo to the latest version
  - open your sales nav inbox from LinkedIn once
  - return to Kondo and messages should start loading

  You can filter messages with **Cmd + K -\> Sales Nav** to show / hide Sales Nav threads.
