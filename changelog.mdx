  ## Invites Tab

  The new [Invites tab ](https://app.trykondo.com/connections)in Kondo lets you see all inbound connection requests. 

  Use shortcuts Y/N to accept or reject them individually, or multi-select with check-boxes or Cmd + A to process in bulk. 

  Due to some limitations, the tab loads only the most recent 100 connection requests at at time.
