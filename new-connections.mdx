The [connections](https://app.trykondo.com/connections) tab in Kondo allows you to see all your 1st degree connections on LinkedIn.

You can filter connections for those with no messages yet:

Or search by keyword to find specific connections to reach out to:

Keywords will fuzzy search the entire LinkedIn profile of a connection. You can add multiple keywords with a space in between e.g. "founders san francisco"

Try these types of keywords:

- Name (note that only first name, last name or full name will return results, partial name searches will not work)
- Company
- Job Title
- Location
