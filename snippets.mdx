Snippets help you send templated DMs faster by saving time copy-pasting or typing the same message repeatedly. 

To insert a snippet, type ; in the text box or click the snippet button.

You can keep typing the name of the snippet e.g. ;hi to pick the snippet you want to insert, then hit Enter. 

You can create and edit snippets in the snippet settings: https://app.trykondo.com/snippets

There is no limit on the number of snippets you can create.

### Variables

When creating a snippet, you can use the variables available on the right menu within your template. Kondo will automatically fill the name variable for you.

Adding a custom placeholders will prompt you to fill up the variable with your own custom text before sending. You can add a custom placeholder by inserting a {{phrase}} in curly brackets within the template.
