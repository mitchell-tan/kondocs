Kondo is built around an Inbox Zero workflow. That means treating your inbox like a to-do list and emptying it out regularly.&#x20;

### Why would I want to do this?

If your inbox is a long endless list, you likely spend lots of time scrolling around looking for stuff, or trying to mark things as 'unread' or 'starred' to find them later. This is a huge waste of time.

Instead, we want to help you spend all your time *getting things done* instead of looking for things to do.&#x20;

Inbox Zero makes life simple - every day, your goal is the same. Empty your inbox, and if you do that, you will be 100% sure you have not missed a thing.&#x20;

### So what do I do?

Use the 3 main actions in Kondo to get your inbox to zero.&#x20;

* Archive (shortcut "E") conversations you are done with (they will come back if you get a new DM)

* Snooze (shortcut "H) conversations you want to be reminded to return to later (they will return to the very top of your inbox) &#x20;

* Label (shortcut "L") conversations you want to split into a different tab, *then archive or snooze them as well.*

### But I don't want to *delete* anything...what if it's important?

When you move your books from your desk to your shelf, are you deleting your books?&#x20;

Think about archiving messages in the same way, we're not getting rid of anything for good, just moving them somewhere else, out of our to-do list.
